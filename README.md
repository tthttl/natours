# Start

npm i,
npm run start

# Project description

Goal of the project: Practice SASS and try out modern web design features like clip-path, gradients, animations, responsive images etc.
Floats are purposfully used in order to learn how to handle them, should I encounter them in legacy code..


# Disclaimer
Code is not production ready, its only fully tested in chrome.
Links do not work..
Originally it should have only been html and sass, I added some js to try intersection observers and make the navigation actually work.
